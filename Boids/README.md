Boids Classic
====================

What is it?
---------------------
This is an implementation of boids algorithm, used to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds. 
>As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of emergent behavior; 
>that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case)
>adhering to a set of simple rules. The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:
>
>   - separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
>   - alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
>   - cohesion: steer to move toward the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
